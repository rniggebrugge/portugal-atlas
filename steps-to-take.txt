With Silvia's files:

1/ Save DOC file as text  -> example coimbra.txt
2/ Remove empty lines with sed -i '/^$/d' <filename>
3/ Remove lines with Freguesias with  sed -i '/^Freguesias$/d' coimbra.txt 
4/ Edit head of file, removing address details, keeping line like TRIBUNAL DA RELAÇÃO DE COIMBRA

With Carlos' file:

1/ Remove two right-most columns
2/ Export as CSV file
3/ Remove " quote-mark with: sed -i 's/"//g' carlos-file-small.csv 

Now from "carlos" file:
	- the COMARCA column is matching the COMARCAS in the text file
	- the DESCRICAO column is matching the cities in text file with a postal code


Idea:
	- take DIAP from carlos-file
	- connect DESCRICAO column with text file
	- add all smaller villages
	- add column tribunal


The files are not very large, could be done in Python instead of C.



NOTES:
- careful with accents and comparing strings
- also naming is not 100% consistent, check for missing values
- at least Amares - 4720 has different format, no starting '-' , made many manual corrections! Check for occurence of postal code within the locality name!
- lots of manual corrections and looking up postal codes from wikipedia
